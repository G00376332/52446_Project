# GMIT Fundamentals of Data Analysis Project 2019

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with analyses of tips dataset. This is a final project for Fundamentals of Data Analysis in the second semester of 2019.

[See here for the instructions](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/project-2019-fundda/raw/master/project.pdf)

## The main goal and the key points

Using the Jupyter notebook with descriptive statistics and plots to describe the **tips** dataset.
The task is splited to the following sections: 

* Basic analysis of the dataset
* Checking whether there is a relationship between the total bill and tip amount
* Analyse the relationship between the variables within dataset 

## How to run code the in Jupyter Notebook

There are couple of ways to view and run notebook.

   1. The file can be downloaded locally and run on the PC with Jupyter Notebook installed
   2. It can be viewed in the web browser on the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/G00376332/52446_Project/blob/master/Tips_Project.ipynb)
   3. Directrly on the GitHub

### How to install Jupyter Notebook

The most convenient way to quickly install Jupyter Notebook is the use of Anaconda package.  
Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

Use the following installation steps:

Download Anaconda. Is recommend downloading Anacondaâ€™s latest Python 3 version (currently Python 3.7).
Install the version of Anaconda which was downloaded, following the instructions on the download page.

To run the notebook type in the cmd or commander:
